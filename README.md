# Movie Recommendation System

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system based on user data and preferences. By utilizing a variety of characteristics, the system will be able to suggest movies that are tailored to individual users.

### Key Features:
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailor movie suggestions based on the following user characteristics:
    - Age
    - Movie genre preferences
    - Viewing history
    - Ratings given to previous movies
    - Popularity trends among users with similar tastes

### Approach:
This system leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to:
- Understand patterns in user behavior and preferences
- Identify relationships between movie characteristics and user tastes
- Provide dynamic recommendations that adapt as user preferences evolve

### Technology Stack:
- **Python**: Core programming language for data handling and logic implementation
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation
- **Flask**: Web framework to deploy the recommendation system as an interactive application
